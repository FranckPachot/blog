I was also speaker there for a short live-demo talk during lunch. And that was an awesome experience and the occasion to meet people I don’t see in Oracle User Groups conferences. Organized at CERN, the speakers were able to visit the CMS experiment (A 14,000 tonnes 100 meters underground detector, observing the result of the collision of protons accelerated in the LHC), and that probably helps to motivate the best speakers to come. And kudos to the colleagues at the organization of this event.</p><figure name="a12c" id="a12c" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 286px; max-height: 354px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 123.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ROB9MpYtODoZwE1e137WpQ.png" data-width="286" data-height="354" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ROB9MpYtODoZwE1e137WpQ.png"></div></figure><p name="b0a4" id="b0a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The event was sponsored by Oracle Groundbreakers. Oracle Switzerland offered some Cloud trials where you don’t have to put your credit card number and that’s a really good initiative, finally.</p><p name="d232" id="d232" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And look at the end of this post the video made by Romy Lienhard during the CMS visit and the conference.</p><h3 name="ff55" id="ff55" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Keynote: Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob</h3><p name="b810" id="b810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I really enjoyed hearing Uncle Bob message. I put quotes in bold here. Today, many organizations push to faster releases, more and more feature, and unachievable deadlines. But that, unfortunately, lowers the quality of software delivered.</p><figure name="5368" id="5368" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 455px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 86.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZgvCl3RgejkOw-ueuWHH2Q.png" data-width="1469" data-height="1273" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ZgvCl3RgejkOw-ueuWHH2Q.png"></div></figure><p name="0557" id="0557" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If we value only the lines of code, the frequency of releases, and the number of features, this apparent productivity is: <br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">unstable productivity<br></strong>and will fail one day. But who will be responsible for this failure? As a software engineer, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">you must not ship shit</strong>. You may think that you were forced by your manager’s unreasonable deadlines. But remember that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">you were hired because you know and they don’t</strong>. You must <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">be professional</strong> and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">say no</strong>. Frequent releases are good only when they ensure that you ship only what works and will be stable. IT professionalism must ban the ship of code that will fail and be unmaintainable.</p><p name="1f34" id="1f34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With my DBA eyes, I see many applications that fail to scale with more users, more data, or that break when a database upgrade reveals a bug that was hiding there. This can be solved only at the root: the quality of the design and code. Do not rely on the UAT to find those design weaknesses. Who tests concurrent updates during UAT? Who tests with the future volume of data? Who tests with the future database versions?</p><h3 name="49bd" id="49bd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Error of our Ways</h3><p name="9a30" id="9a30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A nice continuation was Kevlin Henney’s session. He is famous showing when the magic shell of software applications is failing, displaying the naked error stack, blue screen, like:</p><figure name="e1dd" id="e1dd" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/JaapCoomans/status/1123229983311368193?s=20"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="8053" id="8053" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">That’s part of our software maker professionalism: not only ship new features specified by the business, but also be sure to handle all the unexpected exceptions. When errors break the magic of the GUI, you will give a very bad impression of your company, and you open many security weaknesses.</p><p name="8f79" id="8f79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the database area, this means that if you are subject to SQL injection (because not using queries parameters with bind variables), and in addition to that you expose the database and the name of tables, then you are giving two axes to break into your system.</p><h3 name="505f" id="505f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Have fun!</h3><p name="d255" id="d255" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Yes, productivity can be increased by having fun. Holly Cummins from IBM explains the importance of having fun in the workplace and how to get it.</p><p name="75c0" id="75c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the database area, this is probably the main reason to go to DevOps: stop that fight between Developer and DBA and be happy to work together.</p><p name="8960" id="8960" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Follow the link for the blog post and slides, my best part is about DevOps and Automation: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Repetition is boring. Automating stuff is fun.</strong></p><figure name="eb86" id="eb86" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/holly_cummins/status/1123894122190970880?s=20"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><h3 name="69da" id="69da" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Deep learning in computer vision</h3><figure name="0331" id="0331" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--h3"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 632px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 120.30000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*1qfZPA0FoVy7j-K5LtxsIA.png" data-width="1052" data-height="1266" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*1qfZPA0FoVy7j-K5LtxsIA.png"></div></figure><p name="51f1" id="51f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The best demo I’ve seen so far was from Krzysztof Kudryński (Nvidia) and Błażej Kubiak (TomTom). First, showing the coding iterations to solve an image recognition pattern, like a human face wearing glasses or not.</p><p name="c56b" id="c56b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then face recognition, in live demo, with a mobile phone and a laptop: record one face and then be able to recognize the same person within a group of people. Beyond the computer thing, it was also a nice exposure on the demo effect, and the human factor about it. Demos fail in a talk because the conditions are different. I love this fail because of the scientific approach of the speakers to fix it. It didn’t work to record the face of an attendee in the audience. It worked when the speaker did it on himself. Then empirically find what’s different: the glasses, the light,… and finally, the fact that there were many faces in the background. Those things that you know perfectly and forget once you are face to the audience, thinking about your talk, the time, and everything…</p><p name="e03e" id="e03e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The speakers never gave up and finally had a great working demo.</p><h3 name="88e7" id="88e7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Compact Muon Solenoid, Council Chamber and Main Auditorium</h3><p name="d2da" id="d2da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Want to have a look at the venue — between Council Chamber and Main Auditorium?
