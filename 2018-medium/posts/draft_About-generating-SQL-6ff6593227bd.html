Generally, they read (or update) too many columns, more than what is required, too many rows, pass too many parameters, join too many tables… And when they try to avoid this, by running smaller queries, they run too many queries (the famous N+1 issue). Those do not scale because they actually read GBytes of data in order to get a few rows.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="de0b" id="de0b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Reading too many columns go to the table where index-only access can be sufficient</li><li name="0fe4" id="0fe4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Updating too many columns generate a huge amount of redo</li><li name="b53c" id="b53c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Passing too many parameters (bind variables) exhausts resources and defeats the optimizer estimations.</li><li name="a78f" id="a78f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Joining too many tables has to run more joins than required</li><li name="237e" id="237e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Generating generic predicates prevent specific access paths</li></ul><p name="5cd0" id="5cd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">But this post is not about those issues. But rather about <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">why do programmers generate SQL from procedural language rather than writing SQL directly?</strong></p><h4 name="e9c3" id="e9c3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">SQL</h4><p name="1e8a" id="1e8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Structured Query Language was built to be written by end-users as well as programmers. This is why it looks like an English sentence. And this is why it is declarative. You declare the result that you want, but not how to get it. It goes so far that when you want to give some instructions about how a SQL query must access data, you put the hints in special comments, like /*+INDEX(TABLE_NAME,INDEX_NAME)*/ because the SQL syntax does not allow that. </p><h4 name="5bac" id="5bac" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Language Generations</h4><p name="9d22" id="9d22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This distinguishes SQL from the procedural languages (where you describe how it is processed). Procedural languages are called ‘3rd generation’ languages (3GL). SQL is a ‘4th generation language’ (4GL). </p><p name="0439" id="0439" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What are those generations? The hardware on which the code runs, the processor, understands only the machine language, which is just binary instructions, the ‘1st generation’ language (1GL). The ‘2nd generation’ (2GL) is the assembly language which is still very low level. When you write in assembly language, it is transformed into the machine language with an assembler. Easier to code and maintain, 3GL procedural languages are also transformed to lower generation language in order to be run on a machine. This is done by the compiler which parses the text of your program and compiles it to machine language and optimizes it. It can also be interpreted.</p><p name="d7f0" id="d7f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Same idea in 4GL. When you write SQL statement, the optimizer parses it, compiles it and optimizes it into the execution plan, which is a 3GL procedural language, which will be interpreted at runtime.</p><h4 name="3c69" id="3c69" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">SQL generation</h4><p name="272a" id="272a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You see how it works: you write in higher generation language (4GL) and the machine transforms it to lower generation language (3GL). Them it makes no sense to generate SQL from a procedural language. Writing in a procedural language, like Java or Python, which are 3GL, and generating SQL from here is a wrong approach. When doing that, you miss all the power of SQL, like working by set, like adapting to data volume and concurrency, like finding the best algorithm at runtime. Unfortunately, this is what is done by Object-Relational Mapping frameworks (ORM) especially when not spending too much time on specific mapping.</p><p name="7ead" id="7ead" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nobody generates procedural code from assembly code, and nobody should generate SQL from Java or Python. The following shows the right way in green: generation lower language from higher language. </p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="741e" id="741e" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1032px; max-height: 535px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 51.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sdFcZhuI1NplrPcT44kBCw.png" data-width="2361" data-height="1225" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*sdFcZhuI1NplrPcT44kBCw.png"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="2ce7" id="2ce7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve added, in blue, Domain Specific Language (DSL) which can be considered as 4GL as well. You can generate SQL from a database-centric DSL that has all the declarative semantics, like <a href="https://www.jooq.org/" data-href="https://www.jooq.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.jooq.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.querydsl.com/" data-href="http://www.querydsl.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.querydsl.com/</a> or many alternatives. You may think that they are the same as ORM because you code both in Java. But DSL is a 4GL even if you code it from 3GL. If you have a doubt:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4d2f" id="4d2f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">when you code your data access with loops, without mentioning which table, view and column you access, then you are still in 3GL which will generate some generic inefficient SQL.</li><li name="1c52" id="1c52" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">when your code describes the rowset operations (projections, joins,…) applied on your data, you are in 4GL which will map one-to-one to SQL</li></ul><h4 name="3fff" id="3fff" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Reporting (BI, Analytics, Data Mining,…)</h4><p name="c269" id="c269" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When the Data Model is designed for it, like in a Data Warehouse, generating SQL by reporting tools is totally acceptable. Because the mapping from business entities to the Data Mart tables is like a DSL. Actually, when I started in IT I was tempted to write procedural code that generates SQL. The temptation is huge when implementing multi-criteria forms in an application. But that quickly goes wrong on a normalized Data Model. And it is quickly inefficient (like when testing at execution time if input parameter is null). I realized my mistake when I worked with Business Objects (version 3 at that time) which clearly maps all SQL query elements (tables, aliases, columns, joins) to their business meaning.</p><p name="7034" id="7034" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="f22a" id="f22a" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
