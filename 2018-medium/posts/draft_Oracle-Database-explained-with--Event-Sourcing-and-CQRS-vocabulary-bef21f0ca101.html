Not just can we query these events, we can also use the event log to reconstruct past states, and as a foundation to automatically adjust the state to cope with retroactive changes.</em></p><p name="a072" id="a072" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The developer has the impression that we store the state of the application (the current value of data) because this is what they query. But actually, Oracle and most RDBMS are all processing and storing the events.</p><p name="3e8e" id="3e8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is how Oracle and most RDBMS works:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="31b1" id="31b1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">The application describes the application state change, through a SQL statement. INSERT describes what is new, DELETE what disappears, UPDATE what changes. And MERGE can describe a state change which combines all that. Those are not Events but Commands (as the C in CQRS — Command Query Responsibility Segregation). Commands may not be repeatable and may have side effects, as they depend not only on the current state, but also on concurrent commands ordering in a multi-user application.</li><li name="da6c" id="da6c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Those Commands are converted to Events by the RDBMS. This is the Redo stream in Oracle. No change to the application state are done yet. But the redo stream can be used to rebuild it. And this is what is persisted (the Durability in ACID) in the online redo logs. Anything can be rebuild from this as mentioned in the Event Sourcing description:<br><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Complete Rebuild: We can discard the application state completely and rebuild it by re-running the events from the event log on an empty application.<br></em>Of course, the complete rebuild is not efficient and we will see later how to store an application state optimized for Queries (as the Q in CQRS — Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</li><li name="2db9" id="2db9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Reversing Events<br>&gt;&gt; As well as events playing themselves forwards, it’s also often useful for them to be able to reverse themselves.</em><br>Not only useful, but mandatory for the Atomicity of ACID and also, with Oracle and other MVCC databases, for the the Isolation without the need to serialize concurrent reads. The Undo containing the rollback events information is stored as Events, and then goes also into the Redo stream in Oracle.<br>&gt;&gt; <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">It’s worth remembering that all the capabilities of reversing events can be done instead by reverting to a past snapshot and replaying the event stream. As a result reversal is never absolutely needed for functionality.<br></em>This is what has been implemented for Oracle ‘Flashback Database’. But it is not a replacement for reversal events like the Undo. Because the Consistency of ACID would be broken if this past snapshot were done on a subset of the application state. Undo is per transaction.</li><li name="9366" id="9366" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">&gt;&gt; In many applications it’s more common to request recent application states, if so a faster alternative is to store the current application state</em><br>Sure, anyone involved in operations on a production database knows that applying the changes (the redo stream) is possible only for few hours of activity, and in rare cases of media recovery. Once the Redo generated, the events there are simply applied to the current application state. This is done in memory (buffer cache) and is persisted to disk only asynchronously. For ACID Atomicity and Isolation of transactions, past snapshots of the state may be cached as well (consistent read buffers). All this is eventually persisted to disk in order to have some checkpoints identifying snapshots where we can start from in case we need to replay the events.</li><li name="5b28" id="5b28" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Older snapshots can be stored to cover the need to see past data, as backups. Of course, the events are also persisted, required to bring any of these snapshots to a point in time with consistent state</li></ol><h3 name="f0d1" id="f0d1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Command Query</h3><p name="918d" id="918d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--h3"><br></p><ul class="postList"><li name="d7ea" id="d7ea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Don’t save the <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">current state</strong> of objects</li><li name="9c76" id="9c76" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Save the <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">events</strong> that lead to the current state</li></ul><p name="2b41" id="2b41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">no physical design</p></div></div></section>
