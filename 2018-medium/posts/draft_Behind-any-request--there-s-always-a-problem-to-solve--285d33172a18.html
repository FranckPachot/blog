The blog at dbi-services is designed for online reading and the print layout may not optimal. My first reaction was something like: nobody will spend time trying to optimize the print layout in 2019. But I preferred to ask for the reasons and they were very valid ones: </p><ul class="postList"><li name="b913" id="b913" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“when online I don’t have patience to read every line”</li><li name="2a90" id="2a90" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“and also wife gets angry when spending too much time online”</li></ul><p name="fd55" id="fd55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Both make a lot of sense, isn’t it? A requirement that I thought pointless in 2019 finally made a lot of sense.</p><p name="c466" id="c466" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For this specific example, I had a solution. I have a backup of those blog posts in GitHub pages: <a href="https://franckpachot.github.io/pages/2013-2018/" data-href="https://franckpachot.github.io/pages/2013-2018/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://franckpachot.github.io/pages/2013-2018/</a></p><h4 name="c4f2" id="c4f2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Listen and ask “Why?”</h4><p name="d4d6" id="d4d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’m writing this post because it illustrates a general problem in non-DevOps organizations. I see many times a user (developer) coming to the administrator (DBA) with a request like (I’m just taking a simple example): “can you grant me DBA privileges”. And the majority of the DBAs I’ve seen answers either: “No we don’t do that” or “No problem, it is your responsibility”. However, in the first case, the frustrated user will probably find a workaround that is even worse than what he requested. In the second case, we will have soon a mess and a big security issue in the database. In both cases, the lazy DBA did not take his responsibility and his future colleagues will suffer a lot from his decision. </p><p name="81ff" id="81ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Behind any request, there is a reason. In this example, the DBA should have listened to the reason before answering ‘Yes’ or ‘No’, and should have understood the “Why?” before giving any statement about the “How?” proposed by the user. When we are back to the initial requirement, many solutions come up (like, in this example, granting the role temporarily and enable privilege analysis).</p><h4 name="a8af" id="a8af" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Think about “How?”</h4><p name="5f43" id="5f43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The problem in non-DevOps organizations is that the developer comes too late. Meeting the DBA is often the last resort tentative to solve his problems. He tries all solutions, and eliminates them, one by one, when encountering an obstacle in using it. Then, he doesn’t come with a question about finding a solution to his initial problem, but tries to get a solution for the last attempt he failed on.</p><p name="b865" id="b865" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">There is always a good reason behind any request. Always listen to it and ask “Why?” until you understand the initial requirement. Only then, think about “How?”.</p></div></div></section>
