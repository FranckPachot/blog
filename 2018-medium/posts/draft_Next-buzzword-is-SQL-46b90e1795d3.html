For a telco billing use-case, this can be something like: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">For each customer, get his call records, rate them, and add the amount.</em></p><h3 name="d2a6" id="d2a6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Software Developer</h3><p name="9221" id="9221" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We must keep in mind that this is a logical view only, not considering IT science like algorithms and data structures. The developer, or Software Architect, quickly realize that use-case must be implemented in a different way because the high volume (Big Data) of call record arrives in time series and is stored like that. The monthly billing application will rather do something like: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">For each call record, rate it and update the customer account.</em></p><h3 name="c034" id="c034" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Database Administrator</strong></h3><p name="1cfc" id="1cfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The system administrator, or the DBA here as it concerns data, maintains the platform when the application will run, maintaining resources and security. The developer and the DBA must be in constant communication, with the same goal (the success of the project), and this is easier in a DevOps organization to avoid management political fights. The end-user is also in this communication as he did the specifications and can give feedback about performance and evolutions. Basically, 3 people are working together on conceptual, logical and physical views. Each of them has important skills: business knowledge, algorithms, infrastructure.</p><h3 name="064d" id="064d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Top-down Agile Data modeling</strong></h3><p name="641f" id="641f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But working in a threesome is not easy, and some Agile Data methodologies came with the idea that the man in the middle, the logical model, can be skipped. We don’t need developers for Data: the physical implementation (Platform Specific Model) is simply generated from the conceptual analysis (Domain model). There are tools to do that: business objects become java classes and the ORM generates the database. Developers are out of the Data triangle (they are still there, but only for the GUI). Nobody needs to think anymore about the algorithms: just implement the objects and the pseudo-code defined by the business analysis and modern hardware should cope with it without any physical model optimization.</p><h3 name="12d9" id="12d9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Big Data NoSQL</strong></h3><p name="bf0c" id="bf0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">But this doesn’t scale. Even the most performant hardware obeys to physical laws. Data locality, context switching,… you always have a limit. And now there is a rush to scale at the hardware level, without even thinking about the design, because the data developers, who know the data structures and the algorithms, have been pushed out. Those fundamental IT topics are not even taught at school. The logical procedural pseudo-code is implemented as-is in any language. There’s even a preference for interpreters because we forgot what is a compiler and linker — with all the optimization to run efficiently with the physical constraints of the hardware (level of caches, thread concurrency,…)</p><h3 name="a30c" id="a30c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Structure Query Language</strong></h3><p name="2083" id="2083" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The funny thing is that NoSQL was born with this idea: just implement the procedural processing defined in the logical view, without thinking about data algorithms (joins for example).</p><p name="6116" id="6116" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But actually, SQL was invented exactly for this purpose: skip this intermediate development step. The idea of relational databases, is that we can provide a logical model to the business point of view, where the requirement can be defined with a declarative language (SQL). This language is accessible to the user who knows the data, but not the algorithms. We call it Data Scientist today. Then the DBA provides the physical model to store the data with optimal access paths. The RDBMS is doing the optimization: choosing the right algorithm. Coming back to my initial example, the RDBMS optimizer will decide, depending on estimated data volume, and hardware capabilities, if it is better to start with a loop on customers, or on call records. It can even build optimized structures (hash or sort buffers) to solve the problem faster. And the relational database vendors are implementing more and more features — such as Automatic Indexing.</p><h3 name="6a6a" id="6a6a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Data Processing</h3><p name="1d7c" id="1d7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Bypassing the long development optimization is possible. The idea started with relational databases and vendors are improving their engines versions after versions in this goal. But this cannot be done if we keep the specifications as procedural code. It is exactly like when adding hints in a SQL query: you force some access paths which prevents many automatic optimizations. If we can define the requirement with a declarative language, such as SQL, then a lot of things can be automatically optimized. Unfortunately, the initial analysis is often bypassed, in order to quickly release a code that works. Today, you ask for the specifications and you just get send an url to a GitHub repository with some Java or Python code and very few comments.</p><p name="df65" id="df65" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
