			<p>A quick post to show why you should always use LOGTIME=ALL METRICS=Y when using Data Pump. Just look at an example showing the timestamp in front of each line and a message about each task completed by the worker:

<p>Here, I was running an import with PARALLEL=20 and I can see exactly how many tables were processed by each worker. You see it is &#8216;TABLE&#8217; and not &#8216;TABLE_DATA&#8217; which is the proof that 12<i>c</i>R2 can import metadata in parallel.</p>
<p>I see no reason not to use LOGTIME=ALL METRICS=Y always and you will be happy to have this detail if something goes wrong.</p>
